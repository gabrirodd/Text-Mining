"Europe’s geopolitical awakening"
""
"The war against Ukraine proves that Europe is even more in danger than we thought just a few"
"months ago, when the first draft of this Strategic Compass was presented. At stake are the very"
"principles upon which international relations are built, not least those of the UN Charter and the"
"Helsinki Final Act. History is accelerating once again. This crisis has made it even clearer that"
"we live in a world shaped by raw power politics, where everything is weaponised and where we"
"face a fierce battle of narratives. All these trends were already happening before the Ukraine"
"war; now they are accelerating."
""
"This means that our response must accelerate too – and it has. We have taken rapid actions"
"across the spectrum and broken several taboos along the way: unprecedented sanctions,"
"massive support to Ukraine including, for the first time ever, financing the delivery of military"
"equipment to a country under attack and building a wide international coalition to support"
"Ukraine and restore international legality."
""
"We now need to ensure that we turn the EU’s geopolitical awakening into a more permanent"
"strategic posture. For there is so much more to do. The essence of what the EU did in reacting"
"to Russia’s invasion was to unite and use the full range of EU policies and levers as instruments"
"of power. We showed that we are ready to pay a severe price to defend our security and that of"
"our partners – the price of freedom. We should build on this approach in the period ahead, in"
"Ukraine but elsewhere too."
"A Strategic Compass for Security and Defence                                                     5"
"For a European Union that protects its citizens, values and interests"
"and contributes to international peace and security"
""
""
""
""
"Across the EU, there is a clear commitment to learn the right lessons from this crisis and the"
"broader weaponisation of interdependence that we face. This involves us finally getting serious"
"about threats to our strategic interests that we have been aware of but not always acted upon."
"Take energy. We have known for years that energy plays a disproportionate role in EU-Russia"
"relations and that Russia has used energy as a political weapon. We are now fully mobilised to cut"
"our excessive dependence on Russia energy imports."
""
"The war against Ukraine is making it more urgent to achieve a sea change in EU security and"
"defence. This too we have known for years but not always acted upon. Today, no one denies that"
"we need robust capabilities and the willingness to use them against the full spectrum of threats"
"we face. How to get this done in practice is the purpose of the Strategic Compass."
""
"In other words, the Strategic Compass is not the sole answer to the war on Ukraine as that answer"
"goes well beyond the area of security and defence. Similarly, the Strategic Compass is about much"
"more than the war on Ukraine, as we have to confront the full range of threats we face. Indeed,"
"the purpose of the Strategic Compass is to guide the necessary development of the EU security"
"and defence agenda for the next ten years."
""
"The good news is that every day we are seeing more member states ready to invest more in"
"security and defence. We must ensure that these welcome additional investments are done in a"
"collaborative way and not in a fragmented, national manner. We must use the new momentum"
"to ensure that we, finally, equip ourselves with the mind-set, the means and the mechanisms to"
"defend our Union, our citizens and our partners."
""
"In so doing, the EU will also help to strengthen NATO and become a stronger Transatlantic"
"partner: a partner that is more capable of sharing the burden of maintaining international peace"
"and security. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has shown both how essential NATO is for the"
"collective defence of its members and the important role that the EU plays in today’s complex"
"security and defence environment."
""
""
"A new world of threats"
""
"The war on Ukraine is the most serious security crisis in Europe in decades, but threats to"
"European security clearly come from a variety of sources, both within Europe and beyond. Our"
"security interests are at stake also in the Western Balkans, in the Sahel, in the wider Middle East"
"and in the Indo-Pacific."
""
"We should not forget that the world is full of situations where we face hybrid tactics and"
"intermediate dynamics of competition, intimidation and coercion. Indeed, in Ukraine as elsewhere,"
"the tools of power are not only soldiers, tanks and planes but also financial sanctions or import"
"and export bans, as well as energy flows, and disinformation and foreign interference operations."
""
"In addition, we have seen in recent years the instrumentalisation of migrants, the privatisation"
"of armies and the politicisation of the control of sensitive technologies. Add to this the dynamics"
"of state failures, the retreat of democratic freedoms, plus the attacks on the ‘global commons’"
"                                                                                                      6"
""
""
""
""
"of cyber space, the high seas and outer-space, and the conclusion is clear: the defence of Europe"
"requires a comprehensive concept of security."
""
"There is more awareness and agreement in Europe today on the nature of the threats we face"
"– just as there is a process of strategic convergence on what to do about them. Europeans will"
"continue to favour dialogue over confrontation; diplomacy over force; multilateralism over"
"unilateralism. But it is clear that if you want dialogue, diplomacy and multilateralism to succeed,"
"you need to put power behind it. That is the point of ‘learning to speak the language of power’, as"
"I have been arguing for more than two years."
""
""
"The case for ambition and results"
""
"The work on this Strategic Compass started well before the invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, for a"
"variety of reasons the debate on European defence had already accelerated throughout 2021. This"
"had led to a common acknowledgement that we needed a step change. Therefore, EU Leaders"
"tasked me to come up with a way to translate that common ambition into actionable proposals."
""
"Throughout the whole exercise, I have been convinced that we must be ambitious, because the"
"fast-worsening strategic environment is forcing us to act. But equally that we should be result-"
"oriented and avoid our usual European tendency to go for conceptual or institutional discussions."
"It is often easier to talk - and disagree - in abstract terms, than it is to act and agree on how to do"
"things in concrete terms. This attitude we cannot afford."
""
"In all this, it is important to realise that on security and defence, we do not start from zero. Indeed,"
"in recent years the EU has equipped itself with a number of instruments to introduce more"
"coherence into the field of security and defence. The Strategic Compass builds on this process."
"It is neither a crystal ball for predicting the future, nor a silver bullet that will magically enable"
"Europe to develop a common defence policy overnight. It is, however, a guide for preparation,"
"decision and action."
""
"The Strategic Compass is setting out concrete actions in the following four work strands so"
"that we:"
""
"• Act more quickly and decisively when facing crises;"
""
"• Secure our citizens against fast-changing threats;"
""
"• Invest in the capabilities and technologies we need; and"
""
"• Partner with others to achieve common goals."
""
"To strengthen our capacity to act, we will work to reinforce our crisis management missions and"
"operation and will develop an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity to allow us to quickly deploy up to"
"5,000 troops for different types of crises. We will increase the readiness of our forces through"
"regular live exercises (never been done before at the EU level), strengthen our command and"
"control arrangements and promote faster and more flexible decision-making. We will expand"
"A Strategic Compass for Security and Defence                                                        7"
"For a European Union that protects its citizens, values and interests"
"and contributes to international peace and security"
""
""
""
""
"our capacity to tackle cyber threats, disinformation and foreign interference. And we will deepen"
"investment into the necessary strategic enablers and next-generation capabilities. This will"
"make the EU a more capable security provider for its citizens, but also a stronger global partner"
"working for international peace and security."
""
"More than the papers that we usually produce in Brussels, the Strategic Compass sets out"
"concrete actions – with clear deadlines to measure progress. This a Member States-owned"
"document now adopted by the Council. Throughout the process, Member States have been in the"
"driving seat. By signing off to it, they commit to implementing it. There will be a robust follow-"
"up process to ensure implementation. These are major differences with the 2003 EU Security"
"Strategy and the 2016 Global Strategy."
""
""
""
"If not now, then when?"
""
"The history of European integration is full of plans and initiatives to strengthen the EU’s security"
"and defence policy. Most have come and gone. Therefore, sometimes people ask me why this"
"time should be any different."
""
"For me, the difference this time lies in the speed at which the geopolitical context is changing. This"
"makes the case for action more urgent and indeed compelling. This is vividly true for the war in"
"Ukraine and the wider implications that a revisionist Russia has for European security."
""
"However, it goes beyond that: all the threats we face around the world are intensifying and"
"the capacity of individual Member States to cope is insufficient and declining. That is why we"
"Europeans must invest in our capacity to think, decide and act in strategic terms – together with"
"our partners and on our own when needed."
""
"I am encouraged by the new sense of seriousness and strategic purpose that has taken hold in"
"Europe. The threats are rising and the costs of inaction - of ‘non-Europe’ - are clear. I am convinced"
"that we need a quantum leap forward on security and defence, similar to other big jumps we have"
"made in European history."
""
"It is my fervent hope that this Strategic Compass will help us, finally, face our security"
"responsibilities, in front of our citizens and the rest of the world. If not now, then when?"

"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"
"The return of war in Europe, with Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked aggression against"
"Ukraine, as well as major geopolitical shifts are challenging our ability to promote our vision"
"and defend our interests. We live in an era of strategic competition and complex security threats."
"We see conflicts, military build-ups and aggressions, and sources of instability increasing in our"
"neighbourhood and beyond, leading to severe humanitarian suffering and displacement. Hybrid"
"threats grow both in frequency and impact. Interdependence is increasingly conflictual and soft"
"power weaponised: vaccines, data and technology standards are all instruments of political"
"competition. Access to the high seas, outer space and the digital sphere is increasingly contested."
"We are facing increasing attempts of economic and energy coercion. Moreover, conflicts and"
"instability are often compounded by the threat-multiplier effect of climate change."
""
"The European Union is more united than ever. We are committed to defend the European"
"security order. Sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence within internationally"
"recognised borders should be fully respected. Supporting Ukraine in facing Russia’s military"
"aggression, we are showing an unprecedented resolve to restore peace in Europe, together"
"with our partners. A stronger and more capable EU in the field of security and defence will"
"contribute positively to global and transatlantic security and is complementary to NATO, which"
"remains the foundation of collective defence for its members. The transatlantic relationship and"
"EU-NATO cooperation, in full respect of the principles set out in the Treaties and those agreed by"
"the European Council, including the principles of inclusiveness, reciprocity and decision-making"
"autonomy of the EU, are key to our overall security. The EU reaffirms its intention to intensify"
"support for the global rules-based order, with the United Nations at its core. It will also reinforce"
"its strategic partnership with NATO and increase its cooperation with regional partners, including"
"the OSCE, AU and ASEAN."
""
"The more hostile security environment requires us to make a quantum leap forward and"
"increase our capacity and willingness to act, strengthen our resilience and ensure solidarity"
"and mutual assistance. The solidarity between Member States is reflected in article 42(7) TEU."
"The EU has to increase its presence, effectiveness and visibility in its neighbourhood and on the"
"global stage through joint efforts and investments. Together, we can help shape the global future"
"by pursuing a strategic course of action. We must act as a strong and coherent political actor to"
"uphold the values and principles underpinning our democracies, take more responsibility for the"
"security of Europe and its citizens and support international peace and security, as well as human"
"security, together with partners, while acknowledging the specific character of the security and"
"defence policy of certain Member States."

"and defence that are already underway;"
""
"3. Setting out new ways and means to improve our collective ability to defend the security of our"

"We need to be able to act rapidly and robustly whenever a crisis erupts, with partners"
"if possible and alone when necessary. To that end, we will:"

"1. Reinforce our civilian and military CSDP missions and operations by providing"
"them with more robust and flexible mandates, promoting rapid and more flexible"
"decision-making process and ensuring greater financial solidarity, while also"
"promoting close cooperation with European-led ad hoc missions and operations."
"We will strengthen our civilian CSDP through a new Compact allowing for a"
"faster deployment, also in complex environments;"
""
"2. Develop an EU Rapid Deployment Capacity that will allow us to swiftly deploy up"
"to 5,000 troops into non-permissive environments for different types of crises;"

"3. Strengthen our command and control structures, in particular the Military"
"Planning and Conduct Capability, and increase our readiness and cooperation"

"INTRODUCTION"
"We are adopting this Strategic Compass at a time when we witness the return of war in Europe."
"Over the last seven decades, the EU has been playing a major role for stability on our continent,"
"projecting European interests and values and contributing to peace and security around the world."
"With 27 Member States and 450 million citizens, our Union remains the world’s biggest single"
"market, the most important trade and investment partner for many countries, in particular in our"
"neighbourhood, and the largest source of development assistance. The EU is a norm setter and has"
"been a consistent leader investing in effective multilateral solutions. With our crisis management"
"missions and operations operating on three continents, we have shown that we are ready to take"
"risks for peace and shoulder our share of global security responsibilities."
""
"Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history. The EU is more united than"
"ever in face of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine that grossly"
"violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global"
"security and stability. We are showing an unprecedented resolve to uphold the principles of the"
"UN Charter and restore peace in Europe together with our partners. A stronger and more capable"
"EU in the field of security and defence will contribute positively to global and transatlantic security"
"and is complementary to NATO, which remains the foundation of collective defence for its members."
"The transatlantic relationship and EU-NATO cooperation, in full respect of the principles set out in"
"the Treaties and those agreed by the European Council, including the principles of inclusiveness,"
"reciprocity and decision-making autonomy of the EU, are key to our overall security. The solidarity"
"between Member States is reflected in Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union. More broadly,"
"the EU reaffirms its intention to intensify support for the global rules-based order, with the United"
"Nations at its core."
""
"In this era of growing strategic competition, complex security threats and the direct attack on"
"the European security order, the security of our citizens and our Union is at stake. The crisis in"
"multilateralism is leading to more and more transactional relations among states. The spectrum of"
"threats has grown more diverse and unpredictable. Climate change is a threat-multiplier that affects"
"all of us. After three decades of strong economic interdependence which was supposed to decrease"
"tensions, the return to power politics and even armed aggression, is the most significant change"
"in international relations. Terrorism threatens the stability of many countries and continues to"
"challenge national security systems worldwide. Interdependence remains important but it is"
"increasingly conflictual and soft power weaponised: vaccines, data and technology standards are"
"all instruments of political competition."
""
"European security is indivisible and any challenge to the European security order affects the security"
"of the EU and its Member States. The return to power politics leads some countries to act in terms"
"of historical rights and zones of influence, rather than adhering to internationally agreed rules and"
"principles and uniting to promote international peace and security. The high seas, air, outer space"
"and the cyber sphere are increasingly contested domains. Finally, our world is becoming less free"
"with human rights, human security and democratic values under attack – both at home and abroad."
"We face a competition of governance systems accompanied by a real battle of narratives."
"A Strategic Compass for Security and Defence                                                    15"
"For a European Union that protects its citizens, values and interests"
"and contributes to international peace and security"
""
""
""
""
"In this highly confrontational system, the EU and its Member States must invest more in their"
"security and defence to be a stronger political and security actor. Despite the progress we have"
"achieved over the past years, there is a major risk of being outpaced by our competitors: a lot"
"remains to be done for the EU to raise its geopolitical posture. This is why we need a quantum"
"leap forward to develop a stronger and more capable European Union that acts as a security"
"provider, building upon the Union’s fundamental values as laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty on"
"European Union. We can only do so based on a shared threat assessment and a joint commitment"
"to action."
""
"With this Strategic Compass, we set out a common strategic vision for EU security and defence"
"policy over the next 5-10 years and will immediately start its implementation. This will help us"
"build a common strategic culture, strengthen our unity and solidarity and, above all, enhance our"
"capacity and willingness to act together, to protect our interests and defend our values."
""
"In an uncertain world, full of fast-changing threats and geopolitical dynamics, this Strategic"
"Compass guides and enhances our action to make the EU a stronger and more capable security"
"provider. To that end, it identifies clear goals in the area of EU security and defence, the means"
"to achieve them and specific timelines along which we can measure progress."
""
"Concretely it:"
""
"1. Provides a shared assessment of our strategic environment, the threats and challenges we"
"face and their implications for the EU;"
""
"2. Brings greater coherence and a common sense of purpose to actions in the area of security"
"and defence that are already underway;"
""
"3. Sets out new actions and means to:"
"• enable us to act more quickly and decisively when facing crises;"
""
"• secure our interests and protect our citizens by strengthening the EU’s capacity to anticipate"
"and mitigate threats;"
"• stimulate investments and innovation to jointly develop the necessary capabilities and"
"technologies;"
"• deepen our cooperation with partners, notably the UN and NATO, to achieve common goals;"
""
"4. Specifies clear targets and milestones to measure progress."
""
"This Strategic Compass commits the European Union and its Member States in a common effort"
"to achieve concrete results. Its objectives and proposed actions are part of an EU integrated"
"approach and are fully consistent with and complementary to existing policies to respond to"
"external threats that affect our internal security, in particular those laid down in the European"
"Commission’s Security Union Strategy of 2020. EU policies offer considerable leverage that needs"
"to be fully mobilised to strengthen the EU’s security and defence. This Strategic Compass also"
"builds upon the Defence and Space packages that the European Commission presented in February"
"2022. It contributes directly to the implementation of the Versailles agenda."

"1. THE WORLD WE FACE"
"To prepare this Strategic Compass, we conducted the first-ever comprehensive EU Threat Analysis"
"in 2020. This helped develop a common understanding of the threats and challenges that the EU"
"will face in the near future. To build a common strategic culture, we will regularly revisit the Threat"
"Analysis, at least every 3 years, or sooner if the changing strategic and security context calls for it,"
"starting in 2022."
""
"The overall security landscape has become more volatile, complex and fragmented than ever"

"assertive and decisive security provider, better prepared to tackle present and future threats and"
"challenges. Our ability to deploy, exercise and plan together is central to our ambition. Moreover,"
"we must be more resilient against hybrid threats, cyberattacks and climate-related risks, natural"
"disasters and pandemics. We must secure our access to strategic domains. We must invest more"
"and better. More targeted and coordinated investments in innovative defence capabilities and"
"mechanisms will increase our ability to act and lower unwanted strategic dependencies. And our"
"strengthened partnerships will enhance our security. In carrying this forward, we must ensure"
"synergies with work under the Security Union, as well as other relevant Commission’s policies and"
"initiatives."
""
"The actions detailed in this Strategic Compass are ambitious, but achievable with sustained"
"political commitment. This Compass provides the strategic perspective and details the tools"
"and initiatives required to ensure more rapid, decisive and robust EU action. Despite important"
"progress in recent years, the EU is collectively underequipped to counter the whole range of"
"threats and challenges it faces. In light of the current security challenges, we must rapidly change"
"this and narrow the gap between our aspirations and actions."

"The High Representative, in consultation with the Commission and the European Defence Agency,"
"will provide an annual report on the progress made as a basis for a European Council meeting"
"to provide political guidance for our efforts. Based on the revised threat analysis in 2025 and on"
"the achievement of key objectives foreseen, the High Representative will present proposals on a"
"possible revision of this Strategic Compass. Together, we will implement our common security"
"and defence objectives to build a European Union that protects its citizens, values and interests"
"and contributes to international peace and security."

The,European,,Security,,Strategy,,was,,adopted,in,,,,
"December 2003, and has become a landmark in the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
development of the EU’s foreign and security policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For,the,first,"time,",the,EU,agreed,on,a,joint,threat,,,,
assessment and set clear objectives for advancing its,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"security interests, based on our core values. Nothing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
describes our aspirations better than the title of the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Strategy: ‘A Secure Europe in a Better World’ - that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ultimate aim of our actions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Five,years,"later,",in,December,,"2008,",I,presented,,an,implementation,report,to,
the European Council following a mandate by Heads of State and Government.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Entitled,,‘Providing,,Security,,in,a,Changing,World’,this,"report,",elaborated,in,

"worked in practice, and what should be done to improve its implementation. The",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heads of State and Governments have endorsed its analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As you will see yourself, a lot has been achieved in a short period of time. But",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is no room for complacency. We continue to face many complex challenges,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in a world that is changing fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION,,,,,,,,,,
,,OF THE EUROPEAN SECURITY STRATEGY,,,,,,,,,,
,,Providing Security in a Changing World,,,,,,,,,,
Executive Summary,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Five years on from adoption of the European Security Strategy, the",,,,,,,,,,,,
European Union carries greater responsibilities than at any time in,,,,,,,,,,,,
its history.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,EU,remains,,an,anchor,of,stability.,Enlargement,,has,spread,
democracy,,,and,prosperity,across,,our,continent.,The,Balkans,are,
changing for the better. Our neighbourhood policy has created a,,,,,,,,,,,,
"strong framework for relations with partners to the south and east,",,,,,,,,,,,,
now with a new dimension in the Union for the Mediterranean and,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the Eastern Partnership. Since 2003, the EU has increasingly made",,,,,,,,,,,,
a,difference,,in,addressing,crisis,,and,"conflict,",in,places,such,as
Afghanistan or Georgia.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yet,",twenty,,years,after,the,Cold,"War,",Europe,faces,increasingly,,
complex threats and challenges.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Confl,icts,in,the,Middle,East,and,elsewhere,in,the,world,remain,
"unsolved, others have flared up even in our neighbourhood. State",,,,,,,,,,,,
"failure affects our security through crime, illegal immigration and,",,,,,,,,,,,,
"most recently, piracy. Terrorism and organised crime have evolved",,,,,,,,,,,,
"with new menace, including within our own societies. The Iranian",,,,,,,,,,,,
nuclear,,programme,,has,significantly,,"advanced,",,representing,,a,
danger for stability in the region and for the whole non-proliferation,,,,,,,,,,,,
system.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Globalisation has brought new opportunities . High growth in the,,,,,,,,,,,
,"developing world, led by China, has lifted millions out of poverty.",,,,,,,,,,,
,But,globalisation,has,also,,made,threats,,more,complex,and,
,interconnected. The arteries of our society - such as information,,,,,,,,,,,
,systems and energy supplies – are more vulnerable. Global warming,,,,,,,,,,,
,and environmental degradation is altering the face of our planet.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Moreover,",globalisation,,is,accelerating,,,shifts,in,power,and,is
,exposing differences in values. Recent financial turmoil has shaken,,,,,,,,,,,
,developed and developing economies alike.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Europe will rise to these new challenges, as we have done in the",,,,,,,,,,,
,past.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Drawing,on,a,unique,range,of,"instruments,",,the,EU,already,
,contributes,to,a,more,secure,world.,,We,have,worked,to,build
,human,"security,",by,reducing,,poverty,,and,"inequality,",promoting,,
,good,governance,and,human,,"rights,",assisting,,"development,",,and,
,addressing the root causes of conflict and insecurity. The EU remains,,,,,,,,,,,
,the biggest donor to countries in need. Long-term engagement is,,,,,,,,,,,
,required for lasting stabilisation.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Over the last decade, the European Security and Defence Policy, as",,,,,,,,,,,
,"an integral part of our Common Foreign and Security Policy, has",,,,,,,,,,,
,"grown in experience and capability, with over 20 missions deployed",,,,,,,,,,,
,"in response to crises, ranging from post-tsunami peace building in",,,,,,,,,,,
,Aceh to protecting refugees in Chad.,,,,,,,,,,,
,These,achievements,,are,the,results,,of,a,distinctive,European,
,approach to foreign and security policy. But there is no room for,,,,,,,,,,,
,complacency.,To,ensure,our,,security,and,meet,the,expectations,,
,of,our,"citizens,",we,must,be,ready,to,shape,events.,That,means
,"becoming more strategic in our thinking, and more effective and",,,,,,,,,,,
,visible around the world. We are most successful when we operate,,,,,,,,,,,
,"in a timely and coherent manner, backed by the right capabilities",,,,,,,,,,,
,and sustained public support.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Lasting solutions to conflict must bind together all regional players,,,,,,,,,,,
,with a common stake in peace. Sovereign governments must take,,,,,,,,,,,
,responsibility,for,the,consequences,,,of,their,actions,and,hold,a
shared,responsibility,,,to,protect,populations,,,from,"genocide,",war,
"crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.",,,,,,,,,,,,
It is important that countries abide by the fundamental principles of,,,,,,,,,,,,
the UN Charter and OSCE principles and commitments. We must be,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clear that respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial",,,,,,,,,,,,
integrity of states and the peaceful settlement of disputes are not,,,,,,,,,,,,
negotiable.,,Threat,or,use,of,military,force,,cannot,be,allowed,to
solve territorial issues – anywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At a global level, Europe must lead a renewal of the multilateral",,,,,,,,,,,,
order.,The,UN,stands,at,the,apex,of,the,international,system.,,
Everything,,the,EU,has,done,in,the,field,of,security,has,been
linked,to,UN,objectives.,,We,have,a,unique,moment,to,renew,
"multilateralism,",,,working,with,,the,United,,States,and,with,our
"partners around the world. For Europe, the transatlantic partnership",,,,,,,,,,,,
"remains an irreplaceable foundation, based on shared history and",,,,,,,,,,,,
responsibilities.,,,The,EU,and,NATO,must,deepen,their,strategic,,
partnership for better co-operation in crisis management.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The EU has made substantial progress over the last five years. We,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are recognised as an important contributor to a better world. But,",,,,,,,,,,,,
despite,all,that,has,been,"achieved,",,implementation,,of,the,ESS,
remains work in progress. For our full potential to be realised we,,,,,,,,,,,,
"need to be still more capable, more coherent and more active.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,Introduction,,
,The European Council adopted the European Security Strategy (ESS),,
,"in December 2003. For the first time, it established principles and",,
,set clear objectives for advancing the EU’s security interests based,,
,on our core values. It is comprehensive in its approach and remains,,
,fully relevant.,,
,"This report does not replace the ESS, but reinforces it. It gives an",,
,"opportunity to examine how we have fared in practice, and what",,
,can be done to improve implementation.,,
EU High Representative,,,
,"Javier Solana,",,
President of Somalia,,,
Sharif Sheikh Ahmed,,,
and Secretary-General,,,
of the United Nations,,,
,Ban Ki-moon,,
during the Conference,,,
,"on Somalia,",,
held jointly by the,,,
,"United Nations,",,
the European Union,,,
"and the African Union,",,,
,in Brussels,,
,in April 2009,,
,,I.,Global Challenges and,,,,,,,,
,,,Key Threats,,,,,,,,
The ESS identified a range of threats and challenges to our security,,,,,,,,,,,
interests.,,Five,years,"on,",these,have,not,gone,away:,some,have
"become more significant, and all more complex.",,,,,,,,,,,
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,,,,,,,,,,,
Proliferation by both states and terrorists was identified in the ESS as,,,,,,,,,,,
‘potentially the greatest threat to EU security’. That risk has increased,,,,,,,,,,,
in,the,last,five,"years,",bringing,the,multilateral,framework,under,,
pressure.,,While,,Libya,has,dismantled,its,WMD,"programme,","Iran,",
"and also North Korea, have yet to gain the trust of the international",,,,,,,,,,,
community. A likely revival of civil nuclear power in coming decades,,,,,,,,,,,
also,poses,,challenges,,to,the,non-proliferation,"system,",if,not,
accompanied by the right safeguards.,,,,,,,,,,,
"The EU has been very active in multilateral fora, on the basis of the",,,,,,,,,,,
"WMD Strategy, adopted in 2003, and at the forefront of international",,,,,,,,,,,
eff,orts,to,address,,Iran’s,nuclear,programme.,The,Strategy,,
"emphasises prevention, by working through the UN and multilateral",,,,,,,,,,,
"agreements, by acting as a key donor and by working with third",,,,,,,,,,,
countries and regional organisations to enhance their capabilities to,,,,,,,,,,,
prevent proliferation.,,,,,,,,,,,
We,should,,continue,,this,"approach,",with,political,and,financial,
action. A successful outcome to the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review,,,,,,,,,,,
"Conference in 2010, with a view in particular to strengthening the",,,,,,,,,,,
non-proliferation,,,,"regime,",is,critical.,We,will,endeavour,to,ensure
"that, in a balanced, effective, and concrete manner, this conference",,,,,,,,,,,
"examines means to step up international efforts against proliferation,",,,,,,,,,,,
,pursue disarmament and ensure the responsible development of,,,,,,,,,,
,peaceful uses of nuclear energy by countries wishing to do so.,,,,,,,,,,
,"More work is also needed on specific issues, including: EU support",,,,,,,,,,
,for,a,multilateral,approach,to,the,nuclear,fuel,cycle;,countering,
,,fi,nancing of proliferation; measures,,,on bio-safety and bio security;,,,,,
,containing,proliferation,,,of,delivery,"systems,",notably,ballistic,,
,missiles. Negotiations should begin on a multilateral treaty banning,,,,,,,,,,
,production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.,,,,,,,,,,
,Terrorism and Organised Crime,,,,,,,,,,
,"Terrorism, within Europe and worldwide, remains a major threat to",,,,,,,,,,
,"our livelihoods. Attacks have taken place in Madrid and London,",,,,,,,,,,
,while,others,have,been,"foiled,",and,home-grown,groups,play,an,
,increasing role within our own continent. Organised crime continues,,,,,,,,,,
,"to menace our societies, with trafficking in drugs, human beings,",,,,,,,,,,
,"and weapons, alongside international fraud and money-laundering.",,,,,,,,,,
,Since,"2003,",the,EU,has,made,progress,in,addressing,"both,",with
,additional,measures,,inside,the,"Union,",under,the,2004,Hague,
,"Programme,",and,a,new,Strategy,for,the,External,Dimension,of,
,Justice,and,Home,"Affairs,",adopted,in,2005,These,have,made,it
,easier,to,pursue,investigations,,across,"borders,",and,co-ordinate,,
,"prosecution. The EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy, also from 2005, is",,,,,,,,,,
,based on respect for human rights and international law. It follows,,,,,,,,,,
,a four-pronged approach: preventing radicalisation and recruitment,,,,,,,,,,
,and the factors behind them; protecting potential targets; pursuing,,,,,,,,,,
,terrorists;,and,responding,,to,the,aftermath,of,an,attack.,While
,national,action,is,"central,",appointment,,of,a,Counter-Terrorism,,
,Co-ordinator has been an important step forward at the European,,,,,,,,,,
,level.,,,,,,,,,,
,"Within the EU, we have done much to protect our societies against",,,,,,,,,,
,terrorism.,We,should,tighten,,co,ordination,arrangements,,for,
,handling,a,major,terrorist,"incident,",in,particular,using,"chemical,",,
,"radiological, nuclear and bioterrorism materials, on the basis of such",,,,,,,,,,
,existing provisions as the Crisis Coordination Arrangements and the,,,,,,,,,,
,Civil Protection Mechanism. Further work on terrorist financing is,,,,,,,,,,
,"required, along with an effective and comprehensive EU policy on",,,,,,,,,,
,"information sharing, taking due account of protection of personal",,,,,,,,,,
data.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We must also do more to counter radicalisation and recruitment, by",,,,,,,,,,
,addressing,extremist,,ideology,,and,tackling,discrimination.,Inter-,,
,"cultural dialogue, through such fora",,,,,"as the Alliance of Civilisations,",,,,,
,has an important role.,,,,,,,,,,
,"On organised crime, existing partnerships within our neighbourhood",,,,,,,,,,
and,key,"partners,",and,within,,the,"UN,",should,be,"deepened,",in
,"addressing movement of people, police and judicial cooperation.",,,,,,,,,,
,Implementation of existing UN instruments on crime is essential.,,,,,,,,,,
We,should,further,strengthen,,,our,counter-terrorism,,partnership,,
,"with the United States, including",,,,,in the area of data sharing and,,,,,
,"protection. Also, we should strengthen the capacity of our partners",,,,,,,,,,
in,South,"Asia,","Africa,",and,our,southern,neighbourhood.,,The,EU,
,"should support multilateral efforts, principally in the UN.",,,,,,,,,,
,We need to improve the way in which we bring together internal,,,,,,,,,,
and,external,,dimensions.,,Better,"co-ordination,",,transparency,and,,
,fl,exibility,are,needed,across,different,"agencies,",at,national,and,
,"European level. This was already identified in the ESS, five years ago.",,,,,,,,,,
,Progress has been slow and incomplete.,,,,,,,,,,
,Cyber Security,,,,,,,,,,
,Modern,economies,are,heavily,,reliant,on,critical,infrastructure,,
,"including transport, communication and power supplies, but also",,,,,,,,,,
the,internet.,,The,EU,Strategy,for,a,Secure,Information,"Society,",
,"adopted in 2006 addresses internet-based crime. However, attacks",,,,,,,,,,
,against private or government IT systems in EU Member States have,,,,,,,,,,
,"given this a new dimension, as a potential new economic, political",,,,,,,,,,
,and military weapon.,,,,,,,,,,
,"More work is required in this area, to explore a comprehensive EU",,,,,,,,,,,
,"approach, raise awareness and enhance international co-operation.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Energy Security,,,,,,,,,,,
,Concerns about energy dependence have increased over the last,,,,,,,,,,,
,,fi,ve years. Declining production inside Europe means that by 2030,,,,,,,,,
,up to 75 % of our oil and gas will have to be imported. This will come,,,,,,,,,,,
,"from a limited number of countries, many of which face threats to",,,,,,,,,,,
,"stability. We are faced therefore with an array of security challenges,",,,,,,,,,,,
,which involve the responsibility and solidarity of all Member States.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Our,response,must,be,an,EU,energy,policy,which,combines,,
,external and internal dimensions. The joint report from the High,,,,,,,,,,,
,Representative,,and,Commission,,in,June,2006,set,out,the,main
,"elements. Inside Europe, we need a more unified energy market,",,,,,,,,,,,
,with,greater,"inter-connection,",,particular,,attention,to,the,most,,
,isolated,countries,,and,crisis,mechanisms,to,deal,with,temporary,,
,disruption to supply.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Greater diversification, of fuels, sources of supply, and transit routes,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"is essential, as are good governance, respect for rule of law and",,,,,,,,,,,
,investment in source countries. EU policy supports these objectives,,,,,,,,,,,
,"through engagement with Central Asia, the Caucasus and Africa,",,,,,,,,,,,
,as well as through the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the,,,,,,,,,,,
,Mediterranean. Energy is a major factor in EU-Russia relations. Our,,,,,,,,,,,
,"policy should address transit routes, including through Turkey and",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Ukraine. With our partners, including China, India, Japan and the US,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"we should promote renewable energy, low carbon technologies and",,,,,,,,,,,
,"energy efficiency, alongside transparent and well-regulated global",,,,,,,,,,,
,markets.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Climate Change,,,,,,,,,,,
,In,"2003,",the,ESS,already,identified,the,security,implications,of,,
,"climate change. Five years on, this has taken on a new urgency.",,,,,,,,In,,,
,"March 2008, the High Representative and Commission presented a",,,,,,,,,,,
,report to the European Council which described climate change is,,,,,,,,,,,

and,competition,for,resources,exacerbate,,"conflict,",especially,,in,
situations,of,poverty,and,population,"growth,",,with,"humanitarian,",,
"health,",political,and,security,"consequences,",,,including,greater,,
migration.,,Climate,change,can,also,lead,to,disputes,over,trade
"routes, maritime zones and resources previously inaccessible.",,,,,,,,,,
"We have enhanced our conflict prevention and crisis management,",,,,,,,,,,
but need to improve analysis and early warning capabilities. The,,,,,,,,,,
EU cannot do this alone. We must step up our work with countries,,,,,,,,,,
most at risk by strengthening their capacity to cope.,,,,,,,International,,,
"co-operation,",,with,the,UN,and,regional,"organisations,",will,be,
essential.,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,provided by the EU,,
,,,,,,,,and the UN World,,
,,,,,,,,Food Programme in,,
,,,,,,,,Zimbabwe,,
,and Beyond,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Within our continent, enlargement continues to be a powerful driver",,,,,,,,,,,
,"for stability, peace and reform.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"With Turkey, negotiations started in 2005, and a number of chapters",,,,,,,,,,,
,have been opened since. Progress in the Western Balkans has been,,,,,,,,,,,
,"continuous,",,if,slow.,Accession,negotiations,,with,Croatia,are,well,
,advanced. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has obtained,,,,,,,,,,,
,candidate,,status.,Stabilisation,,and,Association,,agreements,have,,
,been,signed,,with,the,other,Western,Balkan,countries.,Serbia,is,
,close to fulfilling all conditions for moving towards deeper relations,,,,,,,,,,,
,with the EU. The EU continues to play a leading role in Bosnia and,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Herzegovina,",,,"but,",despite,"progress,",more,is,required,from,local,
,political leaders to overcome blockage of reforms.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"We are deploying EULEX, our largest civilian ESDP mission to date, in",,,,,,,,,,,
,Kosovo and will continue substantial economic support. Throughout,,,,,,,,,,,
,the,"region,",co-operation,,and,,good-neighbourly,,,relations,are,
,indispensable.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It,is,in,our,interest,that,the,countries,on,our,borders,are
,well-governed.,,,The,European,,Neighbourhood,,Policy,"(ENP),",,
,launched,,in,"2004,",supports,this,process.,In,the,"east,",all,eligible
,"countries participate except Belarus, with whom we are now taking",,,,,,,,,,,
,steps in this direction.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"With Ukraine, we have gone further, with a far-reaching association",,,,,,,,,,,
,agreement,,which,is,close,to,being,finalised.,We,will,soon,start
,negotiations with the Republic of Moldova on a similar agreement.,,,,,,,,,,,

The,Black,Sea,Synergy,has,been,launched,to,complement,,EU,
bilateral policies in this region of particular importance for Europe.,,,,,,,,,,,
New concerns have arisen over the so-called «frozen conflicts» in,,,,,,,,,,,
"our eastern neighbourhood. The situation in Georgia, concerning",,,,,,,,,,,
Abkhazia,,and,South,"Ossetia,",has,"escalated,",leading,to,an,armed,
confl,ict,between,Russia,and,Georgia,in,August,2008,The,EU,
led,the,international,"response,",,through,mediation,,between,,the,
"parties,",,humanitarian,,"assistance,",a,civilian,monitoring,,"mission,",,
"and substantial financial support. Our engagement will continue,",,,,,,,,,,,
with the EU leading the Geneva Process. A possible settlement to,,,,,,,,,,,
the,Transnistrian,,conflict,has,gained,"impetus,",through,active,,EU,
participation,,in,the,5+2,negotiation,"format,",and,the,EU,Border,
Assistance Mission.,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Mediterranean, an area of major importance and opportunity",,,,,,,,,,,
for,"Europe,",still,poses,complex,"challenges,",,such,as,insufficient,,
political,,reform,and,illegal,migration.,,The,EU,and,several,
"Mediterranean partners, notably Israel and Morocco, are working",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,The EU Rule of,
,,,,,,,,,,Law Mission,
,,,,,,,,,,in Kosovo (EULEX),
,,,,,,,,,,is the largest,
,,,,,,,,,,civilian mission,
,,,,,,,,,,ever launched,
,,,,,,,,,,under the European,
,,,,,,,,,,Security and,
,,,,,,,,,,Defence Policy,
,towards deepening their bilateral relations. The ENP has reinforced,,,,,,,,,,,
,"reforms originally started under the Barcelona process in 1995, but",,,,,,,,,,,
,"regional conflict, combined with rising radicalism, continues to sow",,,,,,,,,,,
,instability.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The,EU,has,been,central,to,efforts,towards,a,settlement,in,the
,Middle,"East,",through,its,role,in,the,"Quartet,",co-operation,with,,
,"Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with the Arab League and other",,,,,,,,,,,
,regional partners. The EU is fully engaged in the Annapolis Process,,,,,,,,,,,
,"towards a two-state solution, and is contributing sustained financial",,,,,,,,,,,
,"and budgetary support to the Palestinian Authority, and capacity-",,,,,,,,,,,
,"building, including through the deployment of judicial, police and",,,,,,,,,,,
,"border management experts on the ground. In Lebanon, Member",,,,,,,,,,,
,States provide the backbone of the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"On Iraq, the EU has supported the political process, reconstruction,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"and rule of law, including through the EUJUST LEX mission.",,,,,,,,,,,
,"Since 2003, Iran has been a growing source of concern. The Iranian",,,,,,,,,,,
,nuclear programme has been subject to successive resolutions in,,,,,,,,,,,
,the UNSC and IAEA. Development of a nuclear military capability,,,,,,,,,,,
,would be a threat to EU security that cannot be accepted. The EU,,,,,,,,,,,
,"has led a dual-track approach, combining dialogue and increasing",,,,,,,,,,,
,"pressure,",together,,with,the,"US,","China,",and,Russia.,The,High,
,Representative has delivered a far-reaching offer for Iran to rebuild,,,,,,,,,,,
,confi,"dence and engagement with the international community. If,",,,,,,,,,,
,"instead, the nuclear programme advances, the need for additional",,,,,,,,,,,
,"measures in support of the UN process grows. At the same time, we",,,,,,,,,,,
,need to work with regional countries including the Gulf States to,,,,,,,,,,,
,build regional security.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The ESS acknowledged that Europe has security interests beyond,,,,,,,,,,,
,its,immediate,neighbourhood.,,,In,this,"respect,",Afghanistan,is,a,
,particular concern. Europe has a long-term commitment to bring,,,,,,,,,,,
,stability. EU Member States make a major contribution to the NATO,,,,,,,,,,,
,"mission, and the EU is engaged on governance and development",,,,,,,,,,,
,at all levels.,,The EU Police Mission is being expanded. These efforts,,,,,,,,,
,"will not succeed without full Afghan ownership, and support from",,,,,,,,,,,
,neighbouring,,countries:,in,,particular,"Pakistan,",,but,also,"India,",
,"Central Asia and Iran. Indeed, improved prospects for good relations",,,,,,,,,,,
between India and Pakistan in recent years have been a positive,,,,,,,,,,,
element in the strategic balance sheet.,,,,,,,,,,,
Security and Development Nexus,,,,,,,,,,,
As,the,ESS,and,the,2005,Consensus,on,Development,,have,
"acknowledged, there cannot be",,,,,,sustainable development without,,,,,
peace,and,,"security,",and,without,development,,and,poverty,,
eradication there will be no sustainable peace. Threats to public,,,,,,,,,,,
"health,",,particularly,,"pandemics,",,further,undermine,development.,,,
Human,,rights,are,a,fundamental,part,of,the,equation.,In,many
confl,"ict or post-conflict zones, we have to address the appalling use",,,,,,,,,,
of sexual violence as a weapon of intimidation and terror. Effective,,,,,,,,,,,
implementation of UNSCR 1820 on sexual violence in situations of,,,,,,,,,,,
armed conflict is essential.,,,,,,,,,,,
Confl,ict is often linked to state fragility. Countries like Somalia are,,,,,,,,,,
caught in a vicious cycle of weak governance and recurring conflict.,,,,,,,,,,,
"We have sought to break this, both through development assistance",,,,,,,,,,,
and measures to ensure better security. Security Sector Reform and,,,,,,,,,,,
"Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration are a key part of",,,,,,,,,,,
post-confl,,"ict stabilisation and reconstruction, and have been a focus",,,,,,,,,
of our missions in Guinea-Bissau or DR Congo. This is most successful,,,,,,,,,,,
when done in partnership with the international community and,,,,,,,,,,,
local stakeholders.,,,,,,,,,,,
Ruthless,,exploitation,,of,natural,resources,is,often,an,underlying,
cause of conflict. There are increasing tensions over water and raw,,,,,,,,,,,
materials which require multilateral solutions. The Kimberley Process,,,,,,,,,,,
and Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative offer an innovative,,,,,,,,,,,
model to address this problem.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Piracy,,,,,,,,,,,
,The,ESS,highlighted,,piracy,as,a,new,dimension,of,organised,
,crime. It is also a result of state failure. The world economy,,,,,,,,,relies,,
,on sea routes for 90% of trade. Piracy in the Indian Ocean and the,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Gulf of Aden has made this issue more pressing in recent months,",,,,,,,,,,,
,and affected delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia. The EU has,,,,,,,,,,,
,"responded,",including,,,with,"ATALANTA,",our,first,maritime,ESDP,,
,"mission, to deter piracy off",,,,"the Somali coast, alongside countries",,,,,,,
,aff,"ected and other international actors, including NATO.",,,,,,,,,,
,"Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW), Cluster Munitions",,,,,,,,,,,
,and Landmines,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In 2005, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy to combat",,,,,,,,,,,
,illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition.,,,,,,,,,,,
,In,the,context,of,its,"implementation,",the,EU,supports,the,UN,
,Programme of Action in this field. The EU will continue to develop,,,,,,,,,,,
,activities to combat threats posed by illicit SALW.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The EU has given strong support to the concept of an international,,,,,,,,,,,
,Arms,Trade,Treaty,and,has,decided,to,support,the,process,,
,leading,towards,its,adoption.,The,EU,is,also,a,major,donor,to
,anti-mine,action.,It,has,actively,supported,and,,promoted,the,,
,Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Landmines worldwide. The,,,,,,,,,,,
,Oslo,Convention,on,Cluster,"Munitions,",,agreed,at,Dublin,in,May,
,"2008, represents an important step forward in responding to the",,,,,,,,,,,
,humanitarian,problems,,,caused,by,this,type,of,"munitions,",which,
,constitute a major concern for all EU Member States. The adoption of,,,,,,,,,,,
,a protocol on this type of munitions in the UN framework involving,,,,,,,,,,,
,all major military powers would be an important further step.,,,,,,,,,,,
III.,,Europe in a Changing World,,,,,,,,,
,To respond to the changing security environment we need to be,,,,,,,,,,
,"more effective - among ourselves, within our neighbourhood and",,,,,,,,,,
,around the world.,,,,,,,,,,
A.,A More Effective and Capable Europe,,,,,,,,,,
,Our capacity to address the challenges has evolved over the past,,,,,,,,,,
,fi,"ve years, and must continue to do so. We must strengthen our",,,,,,,,,
own,,"coherence,",,through,,better,institutional,co-ordination,,and,
,more strategic decision-making. The provisions of the Lisbon Treaty,,,,,,,,,,
,provide a framework to achieve this.,,,,,,,,,,
,Preventing threats from becoming sources of conflict early on must,,,,,,,,,,
be,at,the,heart,of,our,approach.,Peace-building,and,long-term,,
,poverty,reduction,,,are,essential,to,this.,Each,situation,requires
,coherent,use,of,our,"instruments,",,including,"political,","diplomatic,",,
,"development,",,"humanitarian,",,,crisis,"response,",economic,and,trade,
,"co-operation,",,and,,civilian,and,military,crisis,management.,We,
,should,also,expand,,our,dialogue,and,mediation,capacities.,EU,
,Special Representatives bring EU influence to bear in various conflict,,,,,,,,,,
,regions. Civil society and NGOs have a vital role to play as actors and,,,,,,,,,,
,"partners. Our election monitoring missions, led by members of the",,,,,,,,,,
,"European Parliament, also make an important contribution.",,,,,,,,,,
,The success of ESDP as an integral part of our Common Foreign,,,,,,,,,,
,and Security Policy is reflected by the fact that our assistance is,,,,,,,,,,
,increasingly,,in,demand.,,Our,Georgia,mission,has,demonstrated,
,what can be achieved when we act collectively with the necessary,,,,,,,,,,
,political,will.,But,the,more,complex,the,challenges,we,"face,",the
,"more flexible we must be. We need to prioritise our commitments,",,,,,,,,,,,
,in line with resources. Battle groups and Civilian Response Teams,,,,,,,,,,,
,have enhanced our capacity to react rapidly.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Appropriate and effective command structures and headquarters,,,,,,,,,,,
,capability,are,key.,Our,ability,to,combine,civilian,and,military,,
,"expertise from the conception of a mission, through the planning",,,,,,,,,,,
,phase,and,into,implementation,,,must,be,reinforced.,We,are,
,developing,,this,aspect,of,ESDP,by,putting,the,appropriate,,
,administrative,,"structures,",,financial,,"mechanisms,",,and,systems,in,
,place.,There,is,also,scope,to,improve,"training,",building,on,the,
,European,Security,,and,Defence,,College,and,the,new,European,
,"young officers exchange scheme, modelled on Erasmus.",,,,,,,,,,,
,We,need,to,continue,mainstreaming,,human,rights,issues,in,all,
,"activities in this field, including ESDP missions, through a people-",,,,,,,,,,,
,based approach coherent with the concept of human security. The,,,,,,,,,,,
,EU has recognised the role of women in building peace. Effective,,,,,,,,,,,
,implementation,,,of,UNSCR,1325,on,"Women,","Peace,",and,Security,
,and UNSCR 1612 on Children and Armed Conflict is essential in this,,,,,,,,,,,
,context.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For civilian missions, we must be able to assemble trained personnel",,,,,,,,,,,
,"with a variety of skills and expertise, deploy them at short notice",,,,,,,,,,,
,and,sustain,them,in,theatre,over,the,long,term.,We,need,full
,"interoperability between national contingents. In support of this,",,,,,,,,,,,
,Member States have committed to draw up national strategies to,,,,,,,,,,,
,"make experts available, complemented by more deployable staff",,,,,,,,,,,
,for,mission,"support,",including,,budgeting,and,procurement.,,,The,
,ways in which equipment is made available and procured should be,,,,,,,,,,,
,made more effective to enable timely deployment of missions.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"For military missions, we must continue to strengthen our efforts",,,,,,,,,,,
,on,"capabilities,",,as,well,as,mutual,collaboration,and,burden-,,
,"sharing arrangements. Experience has shown the need to do more,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"particularly over key capabilities such as strategic airlift, helicopters,",,,,,,,,,,,
,"space assets, and maritime surveillance (as set out in more detail",,,,,,,,,,,
,in,the,Declaration,on,the,Reinforcement,of,Capabilities).,,These,,
,eff,orts,must,be,supported,by,a,competitive,and,robust,defence,
,industry,across,,"Europe,",with,greater,investment,in,research,,and,
development.,,,Since,"2004,",the,European,Defence,,Agency,has,
"successfully led this process, and should continue to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,
B.,Greater Engagement with Our Neighbourhood,,,,,,,,,,
The ENP has strengthened individual bilateral relationships with the,,,,,,,,,,,
EU. This process now needs to build regional integration.,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Union for the Mediterranean, launched in July 2008, provides",,,,,,,,,,,
a,renewed,,political,moment,to,pursue,this,with,our,southern,
"partners, through a wide-ranging agenda, including on maritime",,,,,,,,,,,
"safety, energy, water and migration. Addressing security threats like",,,,,,,,,,,
terrorism will be an important part.,,,,,,,,,,,
The,Eastern,,Partnership,foresees,,a,real,step,change,in,relations
with,our,Eastern,"neighbours,",,,with,a,significant,upgrading,of,
"political, economic and trade relations. The goal is to strengthen the",,,,,,,,,,,
"prosperity and stability of these countries, and thus the security of",,,,,,,,,,,
the EU. The proposals cover a wide range of bilateral and multilateral,,,,,,,,,,,
areas,of,co-operation,,including,,energy,security,and,mobility,of,
people.,,,,,,,,,,,
Lasting stability in our neighbourhood will require continued effort,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the EU, together with UN, OSCE, the US and Russia. Our relations",,,,,,,,,,,
with Russia have deteriorated over the conflict with Georgia. The EU,,,,,,,,,,,
expects Russia to honour its commitments in a way that will restore,,,,,,,,,,,
the,necessary,,confidence.,Our,,partnership,should,,be,based,on
"respect for common values, notably human rights, democracy, and",,,,,,,,,,,
"rule of law, and market economic principles as well as on common",,,,,,,,,,,
interests and objectives.,,,,,,,,,,,
We,need,a,sustained,effort,to,address,conflicts,in,the,Southern,
"Caucasus, Republic of Moldova and between Israel and the Arab",,,,,,,,,,,
States.,"Here,",,as,"elsewhere,",full,engagement,with,the,US,will,be
"key. In each case, a durable settlement must bring together all the",,,,,,,,,,,
"regional players. Countries like Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,,,,,
"and Qatar have played an increasingly important role in the region,",,,,,,,,,,,
whereas this has not been the case with Iran. There is a particular,,,,,,,,,,,
"opportunity to work with Turkey, including through the Alliance of",,,,,,,,,,,
Civilisations.,,,,,,,,,,,
,C.,Partnerships for Effective Multilateralism,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The,ESS,called,for,Europe,to,,contribute,to,a,more,effective,,
,multilateral,,order,around,,the,,world.,Since,"2003,",we,have,,
,strengthened our partnerships in pursuit of that objective. The key,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,partner for Europe in this and other areas is the US. Where we have,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"worked together, the EU and US have been a formidable force for",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,good in the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The UN stands at the apex of the international system. Everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the,EU,has,done,in,the,field,of,security,has,been,linked,to,UN
,"objectives. The EU works closely in key theatres, including Kosovo,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Afghanistan,",,"DRC,","Sudan/Darfur,",,,,Chad,and,"Somalia,",and,,has,
,improved,institutional,,,"links,",in,line,with,our,joint,2007,EU-UN,,
,Declaration.,,We,support,,all,sixteen,current,,UN,peacekeeping,,,
,operations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The,EU,and,NATO,have,worked,,well,together,on,the,ground,in,
,"the Balkans and in Afghanistan, even if formal relations have not",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,advanced.,We,need,,to,strengthen,,this,strategic,partnership,,,in,
,service,of,our,shared,security,,"interests,",,with,better,operational,,,
,"co-operation, in full respect of the decision-making autonomy of",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"each organisation, and continued work on military capabilities. Since",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"2003, we have deepened our relationship with the OSCE, especially",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,in Georgia and Kosovo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,We have substantially expanded our relationship with China. Ties to,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Canada and Japan are close and longstanding.,,,,,,,,,Russia remains an,,,,
,important partner on global issues. There is still room to do more in,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"our relationship with India. Relations with other partners, including",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Brazil,",South,Africa,"and,",,within,"Europe,",Norway,,and,"Switzerland,",,,
,have grown in significance since 2003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The,EU,is,working,more,closely,,with,regional,,"organisations,",,,
,and,in,particular,the,African,,Union.,Through,,the,Joint,Africa-EU,,

"Elsewhere, the EU has developed engagement with ASEAN, over",,,,,,,,,,,
regional,issues,such,as,"Burma,",with,"SAARC,",and,Latin,America.,,

A SECURE EUROPE IN A BETTER WORLD,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,European Security Strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Brussels, 12 December 2003",,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free. The",,,,,,,,,,,,,
violence of the first half of the 20th Century has given way to a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
period of peace and stability unprecedented in European history.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,creation,,of,the,European,Union,,has,been,central,to,this,
development. It has transformed the,,,,,,,"relations between our states,",,,,,,
and the lives of our citizens.,,,,,,European countries are committed,,,,,,,
to,dealing peacefully with disputes and to co-operating through,,,,,,,,,,,,
common,,institutions.,,,Over,this,"period,",,the,progressive,spread,,
of the rule of law and democracy has seen authoritarian regimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
change,into,"secure,",,stable,and,dynamic,,democracies.,,Successive,,,
enlargements,,,are,making,a,reality,of,the,vision,of,a,united,and
peaceful continent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The United States has played a critical role in European integration,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and European security, in particular through NATO. The end of the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cold,War,has,left,the,United,States,in,a,dominant,position,as,a,
military actor.,,,"However, no single country is able",,,,,,to tackle today’s,,,,
complex problems on its own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Europe still faces security threats and challenges. The outbreak of,,,,,,,,,,
,confl,ict in the Balkans was a,,,reminder that war has not disappeared,,,,,,
,"from our continent. Over the last decade, no region of the",,,,,,,,,world,
,has been untouched by armed conflict. Most of these conflicts have,,,,,,,,,,
,"been within rather than between states, and most of the victims",,,,,,,,,,
,have been civilians.,,,,,,,,,,
,As a union of 25 states with,,,,,over 450 million people producing a,,,,,
,"quarter of the world’s Gross National Product (GNP), and with a wide",,,,,,,,,,
,"range of instruments at its disposal, the European Union is inevitably",,,,,,,,,,
,a,global,player.,In,the,last,decade,European,forces,have,been
,deployed,abroad,to,places,as,distant,as,"Afghanistan,",East,Timor,
,and the DRC. The increasing convergence of European interests and,,,,,,,,,,
,the strengthening of mutual solidarity of the EU makes us a more,,,,,,,,,,
,credible and effective actor. Europe should be ready to share in the,,,,,,,,,,
,responsibility for global security and in building a better world.,,,,,,,,,,
EU monitors talking,,,,,,,,,,,
,with internally,,,,,,,,,,
displaced persons,,,,,,,,,,,
,in a collective,,,,,,,,,,
centre in Georgia,,,,,,,,,,,
I.,,The Security Environment:,,,,,,,,,,
,,Global Challenges and Key Threats,,,,,,,,,,
Global Challenges,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,post,Cold,,War,environment,,is,one,of,increasingly,open,
borders in which the internal and,,,,,,,external aspects of security are,,,,,
"indissolubly linked.Flows of trade and investment, the development",,,,,,,,,,,,
of technology and the spread of democracy have brought freedom,,,,,,,,,,,,
and prosperity to many people. Others have perceived globalisation,,,,,,,,,,,,
as,a,cause,of,frustration,,and,injustice.,These,developments,,,
have,,also,increased,,the,scope,for,non-state,groups,to,play,a
part in international affairs.,,,,,,And they,have increased European,,,,,
dependence,,,–,and,so,vulnerability,–,on,an,interconnected,,
infrastructure in,,,,"transport, energy, information and other fields.",,,,,,,,
"Since 1990, almost 4 million people have died in wars, 90% of them",,,,,,,,,,,,
civilians. Over 18 million,,,,,,people world-wide have left their homes,,,,,,
as a result of conflict.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In much of the developing world, poverty and disease cause untold",,,,,,,,,,,,
suffering and give rise to,,,,,,pressing security concerns. Almost,,,,,,
3 billion,,"people, half the world’s population, live on less than",,,,,,,,,,
2 Euros a day. 45 million die every year of hunger and malnutrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,
AIDS,is,now,one,of,the,most,devastating,pandemics,in,human,,
history and contributes to the breakdown of societies. New diseases,,,,,,,,,,,,
can spread rapidly and become global threats. Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is poorer now than it was 10 years ago. In many cases, economic",,,,,,,,,,,,
failure is linked to political problems and,,,,,,,violent conflict.,,,,,
,Security is a precondition of development. Conflict not only destroys,,,,,,,,,,,
,"infrastructure,",,including,,social,infrastructure;,,it,also,encourages,,
,"criminality, deters investment and makes normal economic activity",,,,,,,,,,,
,impossible. A number of countries and regions are caught in a cycle,,,,,,,,,,,
,"of conflict, insecurity and poverty.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Competition for natural resources,,,,,- notably water - which will be,,,,,,
,"aggravated by global warming over the next decades, is likely to",,,,,,,,,,,
,Create,further,,turbulence,and,migratory,movements,,,in,various,
,regions.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Energy dependence is a special concern for Europe. Europe is the,,,,,,,,,,,
,world’s largest importer of oil,,,,and gas. Imports account for about,,,,,,,
,50% of energy consumption today. This will rise to 70% in,,,,,,,,,,2030,
,"Most energy imports come from the Gulf, Russia and North Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Key Threats,,,,,,,,,,,
,Large-scale aggression against any Member State is now improbable.,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Instead, Europe faces new threats whic are more diverse, less visible",,,,,,,,,,,
,and less predictable.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Terrorism:,Terrorism,,puts,lives,at,risk;,it,imposes,large,costs;,it
,"seeks to undermine the openness and tolerance of our societies,",,,,,,,,,,,
,and,it,poses,a,growing,strategic,threat,to,the,whole,of,Europe.
,"Increasingly,",,terrorist,movements,,are,"well-resourced,",,,connected,,
,"by electronic networks, and are willing to use unlimited violence to",,,,,,,,,,,
,cause massive casualties.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The most recent wave of terrorism is global in its scope and is linked,,,,,,,,,,,
,to violent religious extremism. It arises out of complex causes. These,,,,,,,,,,,
,"include the pressures of modernisation, cultural, social and",,,,,,,,,,political,
,"crises, and the alienation of young people living in foreign societies.",,,,,,,,,,,
,This phenomenon is,,,also a part of our own society.,,,,,,,,
Europe is both a target and a base for such terrorism: European,,,,,,,,,,,
countries are targets and have been,,,,,,attacked. Logistical bases for,,,,,
"Al Qaeda cells have been uncovered in the UK, Italy, Germany, Spain",,,,,,,,,,,
and Belgium. Concerted European action is indispensable.,,,,,,,,,,,
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction,,,,,,,,is potentially the,,,
greatest,threat,to,our,security.,The,international,,treaty,regimes,,
and export control arrangements have slowed the spread of WMD,,,,,,,,,,,
"and delivery systems. We are now, however, entering a new and",,,,,,,,,,,
dangerous period that,,,,"raises the possibility of a WMD arms race,",,,,,,,
especially in the Middle East. Advances in the biological sciences,,,,,,,,,,,
may,increase,the,potency,of,biological,,weapons,in,the,coming,
years; attacks with chemical and radiological materials are also a,,,,,,,,,,,
serious possibility. The spread of,,,,,missile technology adds a further,,,,,,
element of instability and could put Europe at increasing risk.,,,,,,,,,,,
The,most,frightening,,scenario,is,one,in,which,terrorist,groups,
"acquire weapons of mass destruction. In this event, a small group",,,,,,,,,,,
would be able to inflict damage on a scale previously possible only,,,,,,,,,,,
for,States and armies.,,,,,,,,,,
Regional Conflicts:,,,"Problems such as those in Kashmir, the Great",,,,,,,,
Lakes Region and the Korean Peninsula impact on European interests,,,,,,,,,,,
"directly and indirectly, as do conflicts nearer to home,",,,,,,,,,above all in,,
"the Middle East. Violent or frozen conflicts, which also persist on",,,,,,,,,,,
"our borders, threaten",,,regional stability.,,,They destroy human lives,,,,,
and social and physical infrastructures; they threaten,,,,,,,,,"minorities,",,
fundamental,,freedoms,,and,human,rights.,Conflict,can,lead,to,
"extremism, terrorism and",,,,state failure; it provides opportunities for,,,,,,,
organised crime. Regional insecurity can fuel the demand,,,,,,,,,for WMD.,,
The most practical way to tackle the often elusive new threats will,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes be to deal,,,with the older problems of regional conflict.,,,,,,,,
State Failure:,,"Bad governance – corruption, abuse of power, weak",,,,,,,,,
institutions and lack of accountability - and civil conflict corrode,,,,,,,,,,,
States,from,within.,In,some,"cases,",this,has,brought,about,the,
collapse,of,State,institutions.,,"Somalia,",,Liberia,and,Afghanistan,,
under the Taliban are the best,,,,,known recent examples. Collapse of,,,,,,
,"the State can be associated with obvious threats, such as",,,,,,,,organised,,,
,"crime or terrorism. State failure is an alarming phenomenon, that",,,,,,,,,,,
,"undermines global governance, and adds to regional instability.",,,,,,,,,,,
,Organised Crime: Europe is a prime target for organised crime. This,,,,,,,,,,,
,internal threat to our security,,,has an important external dimension:,,,,,,,,
,cross-border,trafficking,,in,"drugs,","women,",,illegal,migrants,and,,
,weapons accounts for a large part of the activities of criminal gangs.,,,,,,,,,,,
,It can have links with,,terrorism.,,,,,,,,,
,Such,criminal,activities,are,often,associated,,with,weak,or,failing,
,states. Revenues from drugs have,,,,,fuelled the weakening of state,,,,,,
,structures,in,several,drug-producing,,,,countries.,Revenues,from,,
,trade,"in gemstones, timber and small arms, fuel conflict in other",,,,,,,,,,
,parts of the world.,,All these activities,,,,,undermine both the rule of,,,,
,"law and social order itself. In extreme cases, organised crime can",,,,,,,,,,,
,come to dominate the state.,,,,90% of the heroin in Europe comes,,,,,,,
,from,poppies,grown,in,Afghanistan,,,–,where,the,drugs,trade
,pays,for,private,armies.,Most,of,it,is,distributed,through,Balkan,
,criminal,"networks which are also responsible for some 200,000 of",,,,,,,,,,
,"the 700,000 women victims of the sex",,,,,,,trade world wide. A new,,,,
,dimension to organised crime which will merit further attention is,,,,,,,,,,,
,the,growth in maritime piracy.,,,,,,,,,,
,Taking these different elements together,,,,,,,– terrorism committed to,,,,
,"maximum violence, the",,,"availability of weapons of mass destruction,",,,,,,,,
,organised,"crime,",the,weakening,,of,,the,state,system,and,the
,privatisation of force – we could be confronted with a very radical,,,,,,,,,,,
,threat indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,
II.,Strategic Objectives,,,,,,,,,,
We live in a world that holds brighter prospects but also greater,,,,,,,,,,,
threats than we have known. The,,,,,future will depend partly on our,,,,,,
actions. We need both to think globally and to act locally. To defend,,,,,,,,,,,
"its security and to promote its values, the EU has three strategic",,,,,,,,,,,
objectives:,,,,,,,,,,,
Addressing the Threats,,,,,,,,,,,
The European Union has been active in tackling the key threats.,,,,,,,,,,,
Ç,It has responded after 11 September with measures that,,,,,,,,,,
,included,,the,adoption,of,a,European,Arrest,"Warrant,",,
,steps,to,attack,terrorist,financing,and,an,agreement,on,,
,mutual legal assistance,,,,with the U.S.A.,The EU continues,,,,,
,to,develop,cooperation,,in,this,area,and,to,improve,its
,defences.,,,,,,,,,,
Ç,It,has,pursued,policies,against,proliferation,,over,many,,
,years. The Union has just agreed a further programme of,,,,,,,,,,
,action which foresees steps to strengthen the International,,,,,,,,,,
,"Atomic Energy Agency, measures to tighten export controls",,,,,,,,,,
,and to deal with illegal shipments and illicit,,,,,,procurement.,,,,
,The EU is committed to achieving universal adherence to,,,,,,,,,,
,multilateral treaty,,,"regimes, as well as to strengthening the",,,,,,,
,treaties and their verification provisions.,,,,,,,,,,
Ç,The European Union and Member States have intervened,,,,,,,,,,
,to help deal with regional conflicts,,,,,and to put failed states,,,,,
,"back on their feet, including in the Balkans, Afghanistan,",,,,,,,,,,
,,"and in the DRC. Restoring good government to the Balkans,",,,,,,,,,,,
,,fostering democracy and enabling the,,,,,,,authorities there to,,,,
,,tackle organised crime is one of the most effective ways of,,,,,,,,,,,
,,dealing with,,organised crime within the EU.,,,,,,,,,
,"In an era of globalisation, distant threats may be",,,,,,,,as much a concern,,,,
,"as those that are near at hand. Nuclear activities in North Korea,",,,,,,,,,,,,
,nuclear risks,,"in South Asia, and proliferation in the Middle East are",,,,,,,,,,
,all of concern to Europe.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Terrorists and criminals are now able to operate,,,,,,,,world-wide: their,,,,
,activities in central or southeast Asia may be a threat to European,,,,,,,,,,,,
,countries,or,their,citizens.,,"Meanwhile,",,,global,communication,,,
,increases awareness in Europe of regional conflicts or humanitarian,,,,,,,,,,,,
,tragedies anywhere in the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Our traditional concept of self- defence – up to and including the,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Cold,War,–,was,based,on,the,threat,of,invasion.,With,the,new
,"threats,",the,first,line,of,defence,will,often,be,abroad.,The,new,
,threats are dynamic. The risks of proliferation grow over time; left,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"alone, terrorist networks will",,,,,"become ever more dangerous. ,State",,,,,,,
,failure and organised crime spread if they are neglected – as we,,,,,,,,,,,,
,have seen in West Africa. This implies that we should be ready to,,,,,,,,,,,,
,act before a crisis occurs. Conflict prevention and threat prevention,,,,,,,,,,,,
,cannot start too early.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"In contrast to the massive visible threat in the Cold War, none of",,,,,,,,,,,,
,the new threats is purely military;,,,,,,nor can any be tackled by purely,,,,,,
,military means. Each requires a mixture of instruments. Proliferation,,,,,,,,,,,,
,may be contained through export controls and attacked through,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"political,",economic,,and,other,,pressures,,while,the,underlying,,
,political causes are also tackled. Dealing with terrorism may require,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"a mixture of intelligence, police, judicial, military and other means.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,In,failed,"states,",military,instruments,,may,,be,needed,to,restore,
,"order, humanitarian means to tackle the immediate",,,,,,,,,crisis. Regional,,,
,confl,icts need political solutions but military assets and effective,,,,,,,,,,,
policing,may,be,needed,in,the,post,conflict,phase.,Economic,
instruments,,serve,"reconstruction,",,,and,civilian,crisis,management,
helps restore civil government. The European Union is particularly,,,,,,,,,,
well equipped to,,,respond to such multi-faceted situations.,,,,,,,
Building Security in Our Neighbourhood ,,,,,,,,,,
"Even in an era of globalisation, geography is still important. It is in the",,,,,,,,,,
European interest that countries on our borders are well-governed.,,,,,,,,,,
"Neighbours who are engaged in violent conflict, weak",,,,,,,,states where,,
organised,crime,,"flourishes,",dysfunctional,,,societies,or,exploding,
population,,growth on its borders all pose problems for Europe.,,,,,,,,
The integration of acceding states increases our security but also,,,,,,,,,,
brings,the EU closer to troubled areas. Our task is to promote a ring,,,,,,,,,
of well governed countries to the East of the European Union and,,,,,,,,,,
on the borders of the Mediterranean with whom we can enjoy close,,,,,,,,,,
and cooperative relations.,,,,,,,,,,
The importance of this is best illustrated in the Balkans. Through our,,,,,,,,,,
"concerted efforts with the US,",,,,,"Russia, NATO and other international",,,,,
"partners, the stability of the region is no longer threatened by",,,,,,,,,the,
outbreak,of,major,conflict.,The,credibility,,of,our,foreign,policy
depends,on,the,consolidation,,of,our,achievements,,there.,The
European,perspective,,offers,,both,a,strategic,objective,and,an
incentive,for reform.,,,,,,,,,
It is not in our interest that enlargement should create new dividing,,,,,,,,,,
lines in Europe. We need to extend the benefits of economic and,,,,,,,,,,
political cooperation to our neighbours in the East while tackling,,,,,,,,,,
political problems there. We should now take a stronger and more,,,,,,,,,,
active interest in the,,,"problems of the Southern Caucasus, which will",,,,,,,
in due course also be a neighbouring region.,,,,,,,,,,
,Resolution,of,,the,Arab/Israeli,conflict,is,a,strategic,priority,for,
,Europe.,Without,,"this,",there,will,be,little,chance,of,dealing,with
,other problems in the Middle East. The European Union must remain,,,,,,,,,,,
,engaged and ready to commit resources to the problem until it is,,,,,,,,,,,
,solved. The two state solution which Europe has long supported-,,,,,,,,,,,
,is now widely accepted. Implementing it will require a united and,,,,,,,,,,,
,"cooperative effort by the European Union, the United States, the",,,,,,,,,,,
,United,Nations,,and,"Russia,",and,the,countries,of,the,"region,",but
,above all by the Israelis and the Palestinians themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,
,The,Mediterranean,,area,generally,continues,to,undergo,,serious,,
,problems,of,economic,,"stagnation,",social,unrest,and,unresolved,,,
,confl,icts.,The,European,Union’s,interests,require,,a,continued,,
,"engagement with Mediterranean partners, through more effective",,,,,,,,,,,
,"economic, security and cultural cooperation in the framework of",,,,,,,,,,,
,the Barcelona Process.,,,,A broader engagement with the Arab,,,,,World,,
,should also be considered.,,,,,,,,,,,
,An International Order Based on Effective,,,,,,,,,,,
,Multilateralism,,,,,,,,,,,
,In,a,world,of,global,"threats,",global,markets,and,global,"media,",
,our security and prosperity,,,,,increasingly depend on an effective,,,,,,
,multilateral system. The development of a stronger,,,,,,,,international,,,
,"society, well functioning international institutions and a rule-based",,,,,,,,,,,
,international order is our objective.,,,,,,,,,,,
,We,are,committed,to,upholding,and,developing,,International,,,
,Law.,The fundamental framework for,,,,,international relations is the,,,,,
,United Nations Charter. The United Nations Security Council has the,,,,,,,,,,,
,primary responsibility for the,,,,,maintenance of international peace,,,,,,
,"and security. Strengthening the United Nations, equipping it to fulfil",,,,,,,,,,,
,"its responsibilities and to act effectively, is a European priority.",,,,,,,,,,,
,We,want,international,,"organisations,",,regimes,and,treaties,to,be,
,eff,ective in confronting threats to,,,,"international peace and security,",,,,,,
,and,must,therefore be ready to act when their rules are broken.,,,,,,,,,
"Key institutions in the international system,",,,,,,,such as the World Trade,,,,
Organisation,,,(WTO),and,the,International,Financial,"Institutions,",,,
have extended their membership. China has joined the WTO and,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia is negotiating its entry. It,,,,,,should be an objective for us to,,,,,
widen the membership of,,,,,such bodies while maintaining their high,,,,,,
standards.,,,,,,,,,,,
One,of,the,core,elements,of,the,international,system,is,the,
transatlantic relationship. This is not only in our bilateral interest but,,,,,,,,,,,
strengthens the international community as a whole. NATO is an,,,,,,,,,,,
important expression of this relationship.,,,,,,,,,,,
Regional organisations also strengthen global governance. For the,,,,,,,,,,,
"European Union, the strength",,,,,and effectiveness of the OSCE and,,,,,,
the Council of Europe has a particular significance. Other,,,,,,,,regional,,,
organisations,,,such,as,"ASEAN,",MERCOSUR,and,the,African,Union,
make an important,,,,contribution to a more orderly world.,,,,,,,
It is a condition of a rule-based international order that law evolves,,,,,,,,,,,
"in response to developments such as proliferation, terrorism and",,,,,,,,,,,
global warming. We have an interest in further developing existing,,,,,,,,,,,
institutions such as the World Trade Organisation and in supporting,,,,,,,,,,,
new,ones,such,as,the,International,,Criminal,Court.,Our,own,
experience in Europe demonstrates that security can be increased,,,,,,,,,,,
through,,confidence,,building,and,arms,control,regimes.,Such,,
instruments can also make an important contribution to security,,,,,,,,,,,
and stability in our neighbourhood and beyond.,,,,,,,,,,,
The quality of international society depends on the quality of the,,,,,,,,,,,
governments that are its,,,,,foundation. The best protection for our,,,,,,
security is a world of well-governed democratic states. Spreading,,,,,,,,,,,
"good governance, supporting social and political reform, dealing",,,,,,,,,,,
"with corruption and abuse of power, establishing the rule of law and",,,,,,,,,,,
protecting human rights are the best means of strengthening the,,,,,,,,,,,
international order.,,,,,,,,,,,
,Trade and development policies can be powerful tools for promoting,,,,,,,,
,reform. As the world’s largest,,,provider of official assistance and its,,,,,
,"largest trading entity, the European Union and its Member States",,,,,,,,
,are well placed to pursue these goals.,,,,,,,,
,"Contributing to better governance through assistance programmes,",,,,,,,,
,conditionality and targeted trade measures remains an important,,,,,,,,
,feature in our policy that we should further reinforce. A world,,,,,,,seen,
,as offering justice and opportunity for everyone will be more secure,,,,,,,,
,for the European Union and its citizens.,,,,,,,,
,A number of countries have placed themselves outside the bounds,,,,,,,,
,of,international,society.,Some,have,sought,isolation;,others,
,persistently,violate,international,norms.,It,is,desirable,that,such
,countries,should,rejoin,the,international,"community,",and,the,EU
,should be ready to provide,,,assistance. Those who are unwilling to,,,,,
,"do so should understand that there is a price to be paid, including in",,,,,,,,
,their relationship with the European Union.,,,,,,,,
"EU High Representative Javier Solana, US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,",,,,,,,,,

"Benita Ferrero-Waldner, at the press point after the EU-US Ministerial meeting held during the",,,,,,,,,
Czech Presidency of the EU,,,,,,,,,
III.,Policy Implications for Europe,,,,,,,,,,
The European Union has made progress towards a coherent foreign,,,,,,,,,,,
policy,and,effective,crisis,management.,,,We,have,instruments,in,
"place that can be used effectively, as we have demonstrated",,,,,,,,,in,,
the Balkans and beyond. But if we are to make a contribution that,,,,,,,,,,,
"matches our potential, we need to be more active, more coherent",,,,,,,,,,,
and more capable. And we need to work with others.,,,,,,,,,,,
More active,,in pursuing our strategic objectives. This applies to,,,,,,,,,
the full spectrum of instruments for crisis management and conflict,,,,,,,,,,,
"prevention at our disposal, including political, diplomatic, military",,,,,,,,,,,
"and civilian, trade",,,and development activities. Active policies are,,,,,,,,
needed to counter the new dynamic threats. We need to develop,,,,,,,,,,,
a,strategic,culture,that,fosters,"early,","rapid,",and,when,"necessary,",,
robust intervention.,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a Union of 25 members, spending more than 160 billion Euros",,,,,,,,,,,
on,"defence,",we,should,be,able,to,sustain,several,operations,,
simultaneously.,,We,could,add,particular,,value,by,developing,,
operations,,involving both military and civilian capabilities.,,,,,,,,,
The EU should support the United Nations as it responds to threats,,,,,,,,,,,
to,international,,peace,and,security.,,The,EU,is,committed,to
reinforcing its cooperation with the UN to assist countries emerging,,,,,,,,,,,
"from conflicts, and to enhancing its support for the UN in short-term",,,,,,,,,,,
crisis management,,,situations.,,,,,,,,
,"We need to be able to act before countries around us deteriorate,",,,,,,,,,,
,"when signs of proliferation are detected, and before humanitarian",,,,,,,,,,
,emergencies arise.,,Preventive engagement can avoid more,,,,,,serious,,
,problems,in,the,future.,A,European,Union,which,takes,greater,
,responsibility and which is more active will be one which carries,,,,,,,,,,
,greater political weight.,,,,,,,,,,
,More Capable.,"A more capable Europe is within our grasp, though",,,,,,,,,
,it will take time to realise our full potential. Actions underway –,,,,,,,,,,
,notably the establishment of a defence agency – take us in the right,,,,,,,,,,
,direction.,,,,,,,,,,
,"To transform our militaries into more flexible, mobile forces, and to",,,,,,,,,,
,"enable them to address the new threats, more resources for defence",,,,,,,,,,
,and more effective use of resources are necessary.,,,,,,,,,,
,"Systematic use of pooled and shared assets would reduce duplications,",,,,,,,,,,
,"overheads and, in the medium-term, increase capabilities.",,,,,,,,,,
,In,almost,every,major,"intervention,",military,efficiency,,has,been,
,followed,by,civilian,chaos.,We,need,greater,capacity,to,bring,
,all,necessary,civilian,resources,to,bear,in,crisis,and,post,crisis
,situations.,,,,,,,,,,
,Stronger diplomatic capability: we need a system that combines the,,,,,,,,,,
,resources of Member States,,,,with those of EU institutions. Dealing,,,,,,
,with,problems,that,are,more,distant,and,more,foreign,requires,
,better understanding and communication.,,,,,,,,,,
,Common threat assessments are the best basis for common actions.,,,,,,,,,,
,This,requires,improved,sharing,of,intelligence,,among,Member,,
,States and with partners.,,,,,,,,,,
"As we increase capabilities in the different areas, we should think",,,,,,,,,,,,,
in terms of a wider spectrum of,,,,,,,missions. This might include joint,,,,,,
"disarmament operations, support for third countries in",,,,,,,,,,combating,,,
terrorism and security sector reform. The last of these would be part,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of broader institution building.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The,EU-NATO,,permanent,,,"arrangements,",,,in,particular,Berlin,,
"Plus,",enhance,the,,operational,,,capability,of,the,EU,and,provide,
the,framework,,for,the,strategic,,partnership,,between,the,two,,
organisations,,in,crisis,management.,,,,This,reflects,our,common,,
determination to tackle the,,,,,challenges of the new century.,,,,,,,,
More Coherent.,,,The point of the Common Foreign and Security,,,,,,,,,,
Policy,,and,European,Security,,and,Defence,,Policy,is,that,we,are
stronger when we act together. Over recent years we have created a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"number of different instruments, each of which has its own structure",,,,,,,,,,,,,
and rationale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The challenge now is to bring together the different instruments and,,,,,,,,,,,,,
capabilities:,,European,,assistance,,,programmes,,and,the,European,,
"Development Fund, military and civilian capabilities from Member",,,,,,,,,,,,,
States and other instruments. All of these can have an impact on our,,,,,,,,,,,,,
security and on that,,,,of third countries. Security is the first condition,,,,,,,,,
for development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Diplomatic efforts, development, trade and environmental policies,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
should follow the same agenda. In a,,,,,,,crisis there is no substitute for,,,,,,
unity of command.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better co-ordination between external action and Justice and Home,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Aff,airs,policies,is,crucial,in,the,fight,both,against,terrorism,and,,
organised crime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Greater coherence is needed not only among EU instruments but,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also,embracing,,the,external,,activities,,of,the,individual,member,,
states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Coherent policies are also needed regionally, especially in dealing",,,,,,,,,,
,with conflict. Problems are,,,,"rarely solved on a single country basis,",,,,,,
,"or without regional support, as in different ways experience",,,,,,,,,in both,
,the Balkans and West Africa shows.,,,,,,,,,,
,Working with Partners. There are few if any problems we can,,,,,,,,,deal,
,"with on our own. The threats described above are common threats,",,,,,,,,,,
,shared,with,all,our,closest,partners.,International,,cooperation,,
,is,a,necessity.,We,need,to,pursue,our,objectives,both,through
,multilateral cooperation in international organisations and through,,,,,,,,,,
,partnerships with key actors.,,,,,,,,,,
,"The transatlantic relationship is irreplaceable. Acting together, the",,,,,,,,,,
,European Union and the United States can be a formidable force,,,,,,,,,,
,for good in the world. Our aim should be an effective and balanced,,,,,,,,,,
,partnership with the USA. This is an additional reason for the EU to,,,,,,,,,,
,build up further its capabilities and increase its coherence.,,,,,,,,,,
,"We should continue to work for closer relations with Russia, a major",,,,,,,,,,
,factor in our security and prosperity. Respect for common values,,,,,,,,,,
,will reinforce progress towards a strategic partnership.,,,,,,,,,,
,"Our history, geography and cultural ties give us links with every",,,,,,,,,,
,"part of the world: our neighbours in the Middle East, our partners",,,,,,,,,,
,"in Africa, in Latin America, and in Asia. These relationships are an",,,,,,,,,,
,important asset to build on. In particular we should look to develop,,,,,,,,,,
,"strategic partnerships, with Japan, China, Canada and India as well",,,,,,,,,,
,"as with all those who share our goals and values, and are prepared",,,,,,,,,,
,to act in their support.,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusion,,,,,,,,,,
This is a world of new dangers but also of new opportunities. The,,,,,,,,,,
"European Union has the potential to make a major contribution, both",,,,,,,,,,
in dealing with the threats and in,,,,,helping realise the opportunities.,,,,,
An,active,and,capable,European,Union,would,make,an,impact,
"on a global scale. In doing so, it would contribute to an effective",,,,,,,,,,
"multilateral system leading to a fairer, safer and more",,,,,,,united world.,,,
